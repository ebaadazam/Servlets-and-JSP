Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) are both Java technologies used for building web applications. Despite serving similar purposes, they have different use cases and strengths. Understanding both allows for the effective development of dynamic web applications.<br>

<h4><b>Servlets</b></h4>
<b>Definition</b> - Servlets are Java programs that run on a web server. They act as a middle layer between requests coming from a web browser or other HTTP client and databases or applications on the HTTP server.Servlets handle business logic, the servlet takes requests from the client, performs the necessary processing (like talking to a database), and populates data objects<br>
<b>How They Work</b> - When a web server receives a request for a servlet, it generates an instance of the servlet and calls its service method, passing request and response objects. Servlets can override the doGet or doPost methods (among others) to handle GET or POST requests specifically.<br>
<b>Use Cases</b> - Servlets are well-suited for handling complex processing, such as form data processing, database manipulation, and invoking other business logic.<br>
<b>Advantages</b> - They are powerful for controlling the web page generation process and handling the business logic in a web application.<br><br>

<h4><b>JSP</b></h4>
<b>Definition</b> - JSP is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Once the servlet has completed its processing, it forwards the request to a JSP page. The JSP page uses the JavaBeans set by the servlet to dynamically generate HTML and present the data. It allows Java code and certain predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup content, with the resulting page being compiled and executed on the server to deliver an HTML or XML document to the client.<br>
<b>How They Work</b> - A JSP page is essentially a web page with traditional markup (like HTML) and embedded Java code. The Java code is processed on the server, and it can dynamically generate content before the page is returned to the client's browser.<br>
<b>Use Cases</b> - JSP is typically used for presenting dynamic content and views. It can incorporate JavaBeans or custom tags to encapsulate complex logic, keeping the presentation layer separate from business logic.<br>
<b>Advantages</b> - Easier to write and maintain than servlets for pages where there's a lot of presentation logic. JSP allows web designers and developers to work together more effectively by separating the presentation layer from business logic.

<h4><b>Calling a Servlet from another Servlet</b></h4>
To call a servlet from another servlet in Java, you can use the <b>RequestDispatcher</b> interface provided by the Servlet API. The RequestDispatcher interface allows you to forward a request from one servlet to another servlet or include the response from another servlet in the response of the current servlet. Refer to the file of RequestDispatcher for more understanding
