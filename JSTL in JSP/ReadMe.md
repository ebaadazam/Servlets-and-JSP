JSTL stands for JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library. It is a collection of useful JSP tags which encapsulates the core functionality common to many JSP applications. JSTL supports common, structural tasks such as iteration, conditionals, XML data processing, internationalization, and SQL tags. It provides a way to embed logic within a JSP page without using embedded Java code directly. This makes JSP pages more maintainable and readable, especially for web designers or front-end developers who might not be familiar with Java programming.<br><br>

The JSTL is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) web application development platform. It extends the JSP specification by adding a tag library of JSP tags for common tasks, such as:<br>

<b>Core Tags</b>: For variable support, flow control, etc. (e.g., `<c:set>`, `<c:if>`, `<c:forEach>`).<br>
<b>Formatting Tags</b>: For formatting text, numbers, and dates, and for parsing text (e.g., `<fmt:formatDate>`, `<fmt:parseNumber>`).<br>
<b>SQL Tags</b>: For accessing databases directly from JSP pages (e.g., `<sql:query>`, `<sql:setDataSource>`), though their use is discouraged in favor of separating concerns by using a data access layer.<br>
<b>XML Tags</b>: For working with XML data, including parsing, transforming, and navigating XML documents (e.g., `<x:parse>`, `<x:forEach>`).<br>
<b>Functions</b>: Which are used to manipulate and output data, often in conjunction with the expression language (EL), for tasks such as string manipulation, length calculation, spliting the string etc.<br><br>

Using JSTL and EL(Expression Language) together enables developers to build dynamic web pages without embedding Java code directly in the JSPs. This approach adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, helping to keep business logic separate from presentation logic.<br>

It's important to note that while JSTL can make JSP pages more manageable and can help avoid Java code in JSP pages, complex business logic should still be placed in Java classes (servlets, beans, or other classes) to keep the code clean, maintainable, and scalable.
